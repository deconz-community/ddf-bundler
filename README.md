# vite-vanilla-ts-lib-starter

The starter is built on top of Vite 4.x and prepared for writing libraries in TypeScript. It generates a hybrid package - both support for CommonJS and ESM modules.

This template is made to create a core library by making the tests and having a web based playground. 

## Features

- Hybrid support - CommonJS and ESM modules
- IIFE bundle for direct browser support without bundler
